# ***pysum - pythonchecksum for Windows***

 **Simple and nice looking app to extract and verify checksums.**
 
 **You can run it in two ways: using .py script and .exe file:**
 
 **If you are going to use .py script you have to install these libraries: tkinterdnd2, pyperclip, webbrowser.**
 
 **As for the .exe file, everything is built-in, you just have to open app and start using it! (Windows 10 is fully supported, Windows 7 and less won't work because of Python is not supported anymore on it, Windows 8 is not tested.**
 
**pysum uses the GPLv3 license.**
